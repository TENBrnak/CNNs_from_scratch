# CNNs from scratch
This repository will contain my work as I attempt to develop neural networks to solve the MNIST and Fashion MNIST image recognition datasets.

I will first try to implement these only using linear algebra libraries (numpy and scipy) and later try to implement these in the new ML-focused language Mojo.

# Notes for users
## Installation
- all packages required are listed above, namely numpy, scipy and matplotlib (visualization - optional)
- I recommend running in a Jupyter notebook
- pulling the entire repository is also required to get all the accompanying files such as model saves and datasets
## User Guide
- run the _seminarka.ipynb_ notebook mostly sequentially, I recommend skipping the training stages as they take quite long and using the saved models instead
- this notebook is intended for people who are able to read code, it is a proof-of-concept and in no way, shape or form intended for any actual use
