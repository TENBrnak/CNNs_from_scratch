# CNNs from scratch
This repository will contain my work as I attempt to develop neural networks to solve the MNIST and Fashion MNIST image recognition datasets.
I will first try to implement these only using linear algebra libraries (numpy and scipy) and later try to implement these in the new ML-focused language Mojo.
